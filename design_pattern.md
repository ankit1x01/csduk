## 1. Design Inspiration & Layout (Reference: Made Smarter)

**Visual Style:**

  - **Neutral:** **Pure White** (`#FFFFFF`) – Used for main content sections to ensure readability.
- **Hero Section:** Immersive dark background with dramatic imagery. Bold white typography with yellow accents (horizontal lines, button styles).
- **Typography:**
  - **Headings:** Strong, geometric sans-serif (e.g., **Montserrat**, **Oswald**, or **Inter**) for a bold, authoritative look. Uppercase often used for navigation and buttons.
  - **Body:** Clean, legible sans-serif (e.g., **Open Sans** or **Roboto**).
- **UI Elements:**
  - **Buttons:** Rectangular, sharp-edged buttons.
    - _Primary:_ Yellow background, Black text, arrow icon (`→`).
    - _Secondary:_ Transparent with Yellow/White border.
  - **Cards/Tiles:** Clean cards with minimal shadows. Use image overlays with yellow accents for "featured" items.
  - **Layout:** Distinct alternating full-width sections (Dark Hero → White Content → Yellow Feature → Dark Footer).
